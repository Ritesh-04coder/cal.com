🔧 Fix: Incorrect German Translation for "Date and Time"
📝 Summary
This change fixes an incorrect translation in the German locale file for Cal.com. The string for "bookingDateTime" was either missing or incorrectly translated. It has now been properly added to reflect "Datum und Uhrzeit" in the de/common.json file.

Additionally, the end-to-end test file locale.e2e.ts has been updated to verify this translation is correctly displayed on the /event-types page.

✅ Updated German locale file:
